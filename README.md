**Project Overview:**

This Python script processes a large CSV of uncleaned data from a leak in 2020 containing Chinese car owner data. It splits the file into smaller chunks and changes the data titles in the CSV to allow you to determine what is in each table column. From there it cleans the data by standardizing text, removing duplicates, any invalid emails, and unwanted columns storing them into CSV files separate from the cleaned data (namely garbage.csv and duplicates.csv).

**Features/How it works:**

1. **CSV Splitting**: The script reads a large CSV file in chunks and splits it into smaller files of a specified size (default: ~100MB per chunk) for easier processing since the dataset is so large.
2. **Data Cleaning**:
    - Renames columns from Chinese to English based on predefined mapping. The script uses a dictionary to map Chinese column names to English.
    - Removes unwanted columns (configuration, postal_code).
    - Fills missing values in string columns with 'N/A' and in numeric columns with np.nan.
    - Standardizes all string data to lowercase.
    - Recombines chunks back into one large, cleaned csv (cleaned_data)
3. **Duplicate Removal**: Identifies duplicates based on a subset of columns (name, id_card_number, and engine_number) and removes them while keeping the first occurrence. Duplicates are placed in a separate CSV file (duplicates.csv)
4. **Unwanted Columns**: Two unwanted columns, configuration, and postal_code, are removed from the dataset and saved in the garbage.csv file for later review if necessary.
5. **Email Validation**: Validates email addresses based on a regular expression. Invalid emails are stored in the garbage.csv file.
6. **Garbage Collection**: Saves invalid emails and unwanted columns in a separate CSV file (garbage.csv) for further inspection.
7. **Cleaning Summary**: Outputs the total number of invalid emails saved in the garbage.csv file, total number of duplicates saved to duplicates.csv and number  of entries in cleaned_data

**Prerequisites:**

- Python 3.x
- Pandas and numpy Libraries

**Usage:**

1. **File Setup**:
    1. Place the large CSV file (e.g. dataset.csv) in the same directory as the script.
    2. Ensure that you have enough space for the output files (garbage.csv, duplicates.csv, cleaned_data.csv, and the chunked CSV files).
2. **Run the Script**:
    1. Execute the script with your desired input file and output folder:
3. **Output**:
    1. The cleaned data will be saved in cleaned_data.csv
    2. garbage.csv: Contains all invalid emails, removed unwanted columns, and possibly other garbage data.
    3. duplicates.csv: Contains the duplicate rows found in the data

**Customization**

The following features can be customized for personal usage

- **Column Mapping**: Modify the column_mapping dictionary to rename other columns as needed.
- **Chunk Size**: Adjust the chunk_size_mb parameter in the split_csv_by_size function to change the size of each chunk.
- **Duplicate Identification**: Change the columns used for identifying duplicates by editing the subset_columns list.
- **Email Validation**: Modify the email_pattern regex to use a different or more strict email validation pattern if needed.

**Example Output**

Splitting into chunks of ~100 MB, approx. 15000 rows per chunk.

Found 10 invalid emails in chunk 0

Saved chunk_0.csv and appended to cleaned_data.csv

Saved 5 duplicates to duplicates.csv

Saved invalid emails and duplicates to garbage.csv

Total number of invalid emails saved to garbage: 15
